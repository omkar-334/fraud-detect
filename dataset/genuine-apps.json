However, all 3 companies are approved by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nThe parameters chosen by CIBIL TransUnion, Experian & CRIF High Mark are majorly similar. All 3 companies have a similar mechanism to calculate the credit score. They use repayment history, credit mix, new credit and outstanding debt to make the credit report.\n\nHaving a good credit history in CIBIL will have somewhat similar results with CRIF High Mark and Experian as well.\n\n[Important Note: Goodscore DOES NOT provide any credit repair service.

Whether you need money for short term personal expenses, a long vacation, or to cover medical expenses, you can get an instant loan for any cash emergency with OnePL. \n\n✅Instant Loan Disbursal \n✅Easy Application\n✅No Collateral requirement\n✅Zero Documentation\n✅Flexible EMI options \n\nHow to avail of the best instant loan offer on OneScore💸\nBuild your credit worth by regularly tracking your credit score, & look out for the personalized best loan offer. Depending on your credit score, & other factors, you will receive instant approval for a personal loan through our app.\n\nWhat’s more!💡\nYou can also use the EMI calculator within the app to plan your online loan EMIs & choose from the flexible repayment options. \nSet up payment reminders so you never miss an EMI.\n\nEligibility Criteria for best online loan offer with OnePL👇\nA credit score of 730 & above\nStable employment with monthly salary of >₹20,000\nAadhar and PAN card holder \n\nOnePL features:🚀\n• Lending partners: Federal Bank, South Indian Bank, Kisetsu Saison Finance India (KSF)\n• Loan Amount: Up to Rs. 5 Lakh\n• Loan tenure: Minimum 6 months, maximum 48 Months\n• Interest Rates: 12.5%-18.5% (for Federal bank), 15.9%-16.8% (For SIB), 13.5% - 29.99% (For KSF)\n• Processing fees: 1.5-2.5% (Minimum Rs. 999) for Federal bank and 1% + Rs. 750 Digital document charges + GST for SIB, 1%-4% for KSF\n• APR: 13.32%-27.49% (for Federal bank), 16.54%-20.52% (For SIB),  16% - 42% (For KSF)  \n\nLet's understand this with an example, assuming a personal loan of Rs. 50,000 with a 13% interest rate & a repayment tenure of 1 year. Here’s how your online loan disbursal amount would be calculated:\n\n• Loan Amount - ₹50,000\n• Tenure - 12 months\n• Interest Rate - 13%\n• EMI - ₹4,466\n• Total Interest Payable - ₹4,466 x 12 months - ₹50,000 Principal = ₹ 3592   \n• Processing Fees (incl. GST) - ₹1179\n• Disbursed Amount - ₹50,000 - ₹1,179 = ₹48,821\n• Total Amount Payable - Principal + Interest + Processing Fees = ₹54,771\n• Total Cost of the Loan = Interest Amount + Processing Fees = ₹3592 + ₹1179 = ₹4,771\n\n*In case the loan is disbursed on or after the 6th of the month and your EMIs fall on the 5th of the month, there’s a gap of 29 days between your loan disbursal date & the first EMI. The interest rate charged for this period is called Broken Period Interest.\n\nWhy download OneScore?📲\n\nGet instant loans up to Rs 5 lakh with zero documentation & flexible EMI options.\n\nCheck your Experian and CIBIL score for free.
