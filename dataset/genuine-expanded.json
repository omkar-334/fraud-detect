I think the fonts, theme nd color could be much better for an upi app. Since its a transaction app it should be of solid simple colors. The app kinda is like a game nd all the extra layouts make no sense. Overall the app is amazing, i only have an ick bc of the themes nd layout.",

We\u2019ll update you as soon as these credit bureaus are available on the app.\n\nBenefits of using GoodScore:\nYour credit health will always be in your control with GoodScore:\n\u2705Check your credit score and credit report on the go\n\u2705Get personalized insights through a detailed video\n\u2705Keep track of all your loan and credit accounts under one tab\n\u2705Set reminders for bill payments & EMIs\n\nWhen you have a good CIBIL score, you\u2019ll become eligible to get loans & credit cards from India\u2019s top banks like HDFC Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda, PNB, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, IDFC First Bank, IndusInd Bank, Bandhan Bank, RBL Bank, Federal Bank, etc.\n\nAre CRIF and Experian credit scores different from CIBIL?\n\nCRIF, Experian and CIBIL are different platforms owned by different credit information companies. However, all 3 companies are approved by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nThe parameters chosen by CIBIL TransUnion, Experian & CRIF High Mark are majorly similar. All 3 companies have a similar mechanism to calculate the credit score. They use repayment history, credit mix, new credit and outstanding debt to make the credit report.\n\nHaving a good credit history in CIBIL will have somewhat similar results with CRIF High Mark and Experian as well.\n\n[Important Note: Goodscore DOES NOT provide any credit repair service.

Initially, I was recommended to purchase ICICI WYN, which was later discontinued, and I was asked to switch to ICICI Elevate. During renewal, I received no support and had to follow up extensively. After payment, I was told KYC was needed, but no one reached out. Later, I was falsely informed that calls were made. Due to poor service and miscommunication, I have discontinued my policy. Please improve your support.",

Here\u2019s how your online loan disbursal amount would be calculated:\n\n\u2022 Loan Amount - \u20b950,000\n\u2022 Tenure - 12 months\n\u2022 Interest Rate - 13%\n\u2022 EMI - \u20b94,466\n\u2022 Total Interest Payable - \u20b94,466 x 12 months - \u20b950,000 Principal = \u20b9 3592   \n\u2022 Processing Fees (incl. GST) - \u20b91179\n\u2022 Disbursed Amount - \u20b950,000 - \u20b91,179 = \u20b948,821\n\u2022 Total Amount Payable - Principal + Interest + Processing Fees = \u20b954,771\n\u2022 Total Cost of the Loan = Interest Amount + Processing Fees = \u20b93592 + \u20b91179 = \u20b94,771\n\n*In case the loan is disbursed on or after the 6th of the month and your EMIs fall on the 5th of the month, there\u2019s a gap of 29 days between your loan disbursal date & the first EMI. The interest rate charged for this period is called Broken Period Interest.\n\nWhy download OneScore?\ud83d\udcf2\n\nGet instant loans up to Rs 5 lakh with zero documentation & flexible EMI options.\n\nCheck your Experian and CIBIL score for free.
