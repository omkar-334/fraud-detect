Interest-only mortgages loans are also supported.\r\n\r\nYou can pay off your mortgage early with extra payments. Add one-off, monthly and annual extra payments. Choose up to six additional extra payment amounts and payment periods and the calculator will show how much money you can save on the loan.\r\n\r\nChoose from weekly to annual loan payments and adjust the compounding period from daily through annual periods. The calculator supports Canadian mortgages along with UK annual rest mortgages.\r\n\r\nMultiple rounding options on loan calculations are also available.

You may toggle your tickers by tapping the display center. Change the displayed time frame by tapping the tile's left side.\r\nThe overview tile features a summary of all your coins. If you have input the amount of tokens you own the total sum of your assets will as well be shown here. Tap the screen to cycle through all your assets.\r\n\r\nIn addition to tiles, the app features so-called complications, which enable you to show a selected asset and/or your total assets' value directly on your watchface.\r\n\r\nChoose freely which tickers you'd like to display by adding them in the app's menu. Additionally, you may add the amount of coins you own to have the total worth of your coins shown. You may as well configure which currency your assets are going to be converted to and how your charts are displayed (i.e. line or candlechart, scales etc.)\r\n\r\nThe app uses the CoinGecko API and thus allows you to add all assets listed there. Please refer to https://coingecko.com/ when looking for ticker names usable for input.\r\n\r\nI'll gladly take any feedback, bug reports and feature requests you have. Just send me a mail at tiles@tobias-goerke.de and we'll be in touch.\r\n\r\nAlso check out the StockTiles app for managing your favorite stock assets.",
